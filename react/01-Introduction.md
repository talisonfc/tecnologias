# What is React:

React is a libry for create UI

React has a few different kinds of components, but we will start by React.Component

## React.Component

A react component has some built in special properies for keep information about the component it.

- props: properties of the component
- state: variable to keep state of the component

All component that has a constructor shoul start it with a super(props)

React keep a key for all Element to be rendered. It's important for reac know which elements update or remove. React has built in a keyword key that we can not use it with props.key, because react use it for reference a element when he is render.

For a list, that we had a lot of element, if we not define a key for each elements, so react goes return follow mistake:

		Warning: Each child in an array or iterator
		should have a unique “key” prop. Check the 
		render method of “Game”.
